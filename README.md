# Initial setup
Run `npm install` to install all node dependencies.

# To build extensions for study in bulk:

 1. python Builder.py [amount]
	-  amount is optional, defaults to ten. If you want to just test the extension do `python Builder.py 1`
 2. In ./builds, you will see user folders, each folder has it's own customized mobyweb extension, as well as the reporting extension. Install both onto chrome.
